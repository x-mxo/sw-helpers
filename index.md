# Welcome to Workbox

Workbox is a suite of helper libraries for service workers and progressive web
apps that lets you implement precaching in a manner of minutes. Its features
support runtime caching, routing, offline analytics, background syncing, and
more.

## A service worker in two minutes

Use [sw-cli](sw-cli) to add a service worker to an existing project in under two
minutes. 

## A build script in ten minutes

Generate a service worker in your build process
using [sw-build](sw-build).

## Much more

Go beyond the basics. If you'd like to use the Workbox libraries, and you
already have your own service worker, then checkout
[sw-lib](sw-lib) which lets
you add to what you've already got.

If you've been using Workbox for a while, or you're
ambitious, you can delve into its more advanced features. Browse the
[recipes section](recipes), try the [examples](examples), or look up
something in the [mobules reference](reference-docs/stable/latest/).
