 * An implementation of a [cache-only](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-only)

 * it will use the cache configuration and trigger the plugins defined in
 * the underlying `RequestWrapper`.
 *
 * @example
 * // Set up a route to match any requests made for URLs that end in .txt.
 * // The requests are handled with a cache-only strategy.
 * const route = new goog.routing.RegExpRoute({
 *   regExp: /\.txt$/,
 *   handler: new goog.runtimeCaching.CacheOnly(),
 * });
 *
 * const router = new goog.routing.Router();
 * router.registerRoute({route});
