 * An implementation of a [cache-first](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)
 * request strategy.
 *
 * The important thing to note with this caching strategy is that once a
 * response is cached, it will not be updated. This is useful for assets
 * that are revisioned as it caches the asset long term and doesn't waste
 * the user's data.
 *
 * @example
 * // Set up a route to match any requests made for URLs that end in .txt.
 * // The requests are handled with a cache-first strategy.
 * const route = new goog.routing.RegExpRoute({
 *   regExp: /\.txt$/,
 *   handler: new goog.runtimeCaching.CacheFirst(),
 * });
 *
 * const router = new goog.routing.Router();
 * router.registerRoute({route});
 *
