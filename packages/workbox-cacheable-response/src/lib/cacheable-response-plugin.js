/**
 * Use this plugin to cache responses with certain HTTP status codes or
 * header values.
 *
 * Defining both status codes and headers will cache requests with a matching
 * status code and a matching header.
 *
 * This class is meant to be automatically invoked as a plugin to a
 * {@link module:workbox-runtime-caching.RequestWrapper|RequestWrapper}, which
 * is used by the `workbox-sw` and `workbox-runtime-caching` modules.
 *
 * If you would like to use this functionality outside of the `RequestWrapper`
 * context, please use the `CacheableResponse` class directly.
 *
 * @example
 * new goog.cacheableResponse.CacheableResponsePlugin({
 *   statuses: [0, 200, 404],
 *   headers: {
 *     'Example-Header-1': 'Header-Value-1'
 *     'Example-Header-2': 'Header-Value-2'
 *   }
 * });
